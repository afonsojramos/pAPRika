The pAPRika website was created with the help of the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/), a flexible two-column Jekyll theme, perfect for building personal sites, blogs, and portfolios. As the name implies, styling is purposely minimalistic to be enhanced and customized by you :smile:.

## Usage

For detailed instructions on how to configure, customize, add/migrate content, and more read the [theme's documentation](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/quick-start-guide/).

## Development

First of all, install [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/).

Now, you can set up your environment to develop this theme, by running `bundle install`.

To test the theme, run `bundle exec jekyll serve` and open your browser at `http://localhost:4000/test/`. This starts a Jekyll server using content in the `test/` directory. As modifications are made to the theme and test site, it will regenerate and you should see the changes in the browser after a refresh.
